Aiko project
============

This project is part of the
[Aiko Platform](https://sites.google.com/site/aikoplatform)

This repository used to contain multiple projects ...
- [Aiko Framework library](https://github.com/geekscape/aiko_arduino) for Arduino
- [Aiko Pebble](https://github.com/geekscape/aiko_pebble) sketch for an Arduino shield
- [Aiko Gateway](https://github.com/geekscape/aiko_gateway) for the OpenWRT router

Each of these projects have now been moved to their own GitHub repository.
